My name is Oliver Black, i was born in 2004, making me 16 y/o this year. I started an interest in IT when i was interested in how games were
developed when i was about 12 years old. I since then have only watched youtube videos learning mainly how to code in C# for Unity3D a game
development software. I have made many small games over the years that have been lost to time or just deleted. My ideal job would definitly
be in Game Development, i would love to someday run an Indie game company or work alone and make money off of making games in my own home. I find
game development quite interesting and i believe working in that field would be a fun experience. Valve is another game development company who has created
some of my favourite games, working for them would also be ideal to me. I used to enjoy making music using applications such as Ableton. There is not really any
interesting facts about myself. My faveourite pet animals would be cats, especially Maine Coons, we have owned 3 of them before, but only have 1 now. I also have 3 pet Pomeranians
and used to have a Macaw.
